        <p>

            Over the past few weeks, I have worked on developing two simple to-do apps:
            one with vanilla JavaScript and one with React. Although these approaches have many similarities,
            they also have some drastic differences in their uses. Working hands-on is, I believe, the best way to
            understand the differences between them. However, I am going to explain their differences in this article
            today. </p>


        <h2>What is the difference between vanilla JavaScript and React? </h2>

        <p>To describe the difference in vanilla Javascript and React generally, vanilla is the core web language,
            and React consists of libraries used for UI.
            <br><BR>
            Vanilla JavaScript pertains to plain JavaScript. It is used for smaller things and does not have any added
            libraries or features.
            It also does not contain any built-in organization systems

            React is a JavaScript library that creates reusable UI components. It can be applied to whole pages and has
            built in organization systems. React provides a structured and efficient way to
            build complex user interfaces
            by promoting component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and state management.
        </p>



        <h2>Comparison of structure, syntax, and organization. </h2>

        <p> Vanilla JavaScript is written using core language features. Some of these features include DOM manipulation,
            event handling, and AJAX requests.
            As I mentioned earlier, vanilla Javascript does not have any built-in organization systems. This means that
            developers must organize their
            code manually to avoid having an unreadable mess of code.
            <br><br>
            React uses JavaScript XML (JSX), which is an extension that allows JavaScript to be written similarly to
            HTML. Since React is a collection of libraries, it does have built-in organizational systems.
            <br><br>
            Vanilla directly affects the DOM, while React edits a virtual DOM. Directly editing the DOM may be helpful
            in some scenarios, however
            it can make sites load slower due to the amount of requests being made. Reacts virtual DOM is a more
            lightweight version of the DOM that
            detects when to manipulate the actual DOM to increase the pageâ€™s speed.
        </p>

        <h2>Reusability and Maintenance. </h2>

        <p>One of the most prominent differences between vanilla Javascript and React that I noticed quickly upon
            developing the two apps was that
            React elements are far more reusable than vanilla elements. React functions are self-contained, making them
            easier to reuse across different pages
            and projects. This feature makes them much easier to maintain than their vanilla JavaScript counterparts.
        </p>
        <div class="comparison">
            <div id="react">React delete button<img src="images/react.png" alt="React delete button code"></div>
            <div id="vanilla">Vanilla delete button<img src="images/vanilla.png" alt="vanilla delete button code"></div>
        </div>
        <P> React Offers a built-in state management system
            where each component can have its own state and get
            modified.
            React also integrates with libraries for more complex state management needs.
            <br><br>
            Vanilla JavaScript Developers have to manage state manually, often resulting in hard-to-read code or complex
            state management solutions.
        </p>



        <h2>Learning Curve. </h2>

        <p>I found learning vanilla JavaScript to be simpler than learning React. However, I know that React will be
            easier to develop with once
            I fully understand it since it streamlines the development process and makes it more efficient. Learning
            vanilla first helped me with learning React
            since they share similarities in their concepts and functionality.
            <br><br>
            React is easier to use for developing larger projects since it can streamline the development process and
            make it more efficient,
            while vanilla is easier for developing for smaller
            projects/aspects.
        </p>



        <h2>UI Aspects</h2>

        <p> In Vanilla JavaScript, developers create UI elements programmatically by using methods like
            document.createElement() to sirectly manipulate the DOM.
            <br><br>
            React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript
            files. JSX makes it easier to describe
            the structure of UI components, improves code readability, and enables a more declarative approach to
            building user interfaces.
